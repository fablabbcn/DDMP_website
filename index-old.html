                    <p>
                        Designers’ practices have constantly evolved in the last two centuries, and during the last decades new design and production paradigms have emerged, transforming the discipline from processes developed exclusively by professionals to processes where users have an increasingly important and active role. The increasing number of designers and creative individuals (which is not accompanied by an equally strong design job demand) represents a new condition that pushes some of them to self-produce goods, often at a small scale, by integrating complementary resources they do not possess. This is possible thanks to a wide network of physical and digital platforms for learning and training, research, design, production, distribution and (micro)financing. This trend is strongly connected with the Maker movement, a loose global movement of individuals who focus on making physical projects but with a digital layer and digital tools, often with collaborative processes and the sharing of the digital files or documentation. Makers often meet and work in globally-networked laboratories such as Fab Labs, Makerspaces and Hackerspaces that provide access to a local and global community of like-minded actors and to several digital fabrication technologies able to manufacture easily and locally digital projects. The democratization of technology, education, content and community building of such laboratories increases the possibilities for professional and amateur designers and at the same time it opens up new possibilities of collaboration and interaction among them and with other stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these phenomena, which integrate design skills and the ‘making’ approach, enable the development of new entrepreneurial types of professional producers. On one hand designers acquire more technological and practical skills, on the other hand, makers evolve their design attitude and capabilities. The design discipline is becoming thus Distributed Design, distributed among several actors, several approaches, several locations and laboratories. This project aims at improving such scenario and making it financially sustainable by connecting makers with the market, with the Makers to Market approach.

                        Since 2013 Fab City Research Lab (previously known as Fab Lab Barcelona) has developed Fablabs.io (fablabs.io) , the online social network and official platform of the global Fab Lab Network, where Fab Labs are mapped, knowledge is shared, projects are developed and where the community discuss these topics. Fablabs.io is an exchange platform for people, labs, projects, machines, events and groups that operate around the Fab Lab Network, which collaboration and communication tools in order to align interests and to expand the global scale of this community. Fablabs.io is an open, creative community of more than 10,000 registered users who are fabricators, artists, scientists, engineers, educators, students, amateurs, professionals, ages 5 to 75+, located in more than 40 countries in more than 1,000 Fab Labs. By using Fablabs.io all Fab Labs are mapped and connected globally, and their knowledge and technical and design innovations become embedded in the larger ecosystem of the Fab Lab Network. Such a platform is developed and released as open source software, enabling thus its adoption for any network of distributed labs, places, events, organizations and projects, making this development available to all the stakeholders. Fablabs.io also hosts the DDMP ( http://market.fablabs.io/ ), which enable makers and independent designers to commercialize their projects with the help of the global Fab Lab Network. Furthermore, Fablabs.io has already been part of several Horizon 2020 and Creative Europe projects (MAKE-IT , Making Sense , Made@1 2 EU3) and it has also been adopted by other European projects (TCBL4, the European network of the Textile and Clothing Business Labs), which adopted or developed and tested specific functionalities not explored by this proposal, which is a continuation of the Made@EU Creative Europe project.. Therefore such platform provides an established network of stakeholders that can be be reached and affected easily in order to promote the connection of makers and designers with the market. The Platform of this proposal therefore works on top of Fablabs.io, an already established platform at global level.
